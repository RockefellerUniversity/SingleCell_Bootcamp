## Sequencing

The emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies such as 454 (Roche) and Solexa (Illumina) sequencing allowed for the highly parallel short read sequencing of DNA molecules.

- 454 (Roche) ~ 2005
- Solexa (Illumina)  ~ 2006

## Sequence files - FastQ
 **FastQ (FASTA with Qualities)**
<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fq1.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="800">
</div>

- "@" followed by identifier.
- Sequence information.
- "+" 
- Quality scores encodes as ASCI.

---

## Sequence files - FastQ
 **FastQ - Header**
 <div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fq2.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="800">
</div>
- Header for each read can contain additional information
    - HS2000-887_89 - Machine name.
    - 5 - Flowcell lane.
    - /1 - Read 1 or 2 of pair (here read 1)
    
---

## Sequence files - FastQ
 **FastQ - Qualities**
 <div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fq3.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="800">
</div>
 
- Qualities follow "+" line.
- -log10 probability of sequence base being wrong. 
- Encoded in ASCI to save space.
- Used in quality assessment and downstream analysis
 

---

## Sequencing use-cases

- ChIP-seq - Study transcription factor binding
- RNA-seq - Study genome wide transcriptomics
- Whole Genome/Exome Sequencing - Study genome variation/changes
- MNAseq/DNAse-seq/ATAC-seq - Study chromatin structure/accessibility
- CrispR-seq - Study genome wide phenotypes
- And many more..

---

## Bulk sequencing methods

Sequencing typically performed on bulk tissue or cells.

- Tissues - Liver vs Heart
- Conditions - Cancer vs surrounding normal tissue
- Treatments - Hep-G2 cells with/without rapamycin 
- Genetic perturbation - Ikzf WT/KO in B-cells.

Analysis of the bulk characteristics of data without understanding of hetergeneity of data.

---
## FACS Cell and Nuclei sorting

Newer technologies such as TRAP from the Heintz lab or nuclei sorting allow for capture of distinct cell types based on expressed markers.

Pros
- Allow for the capure of rare cell populations such as specific neuron types.

Cons
- Require known markers for desired cell populations

---
## Single-cell sequencing

With the advent of advanced microfluidics and refined sequencing technlogies, single-cell sequencing has emerged as a technology to profile individual cells from a heterogenous population without prior knowledge of cell populations.

Pros
- No prior knowledge of cell populations required.
- Simultaneously assess profiles of 1000s of cells.

Cons
- Low sequencing sequencing depth for individual cells (1000s vs millions of reads for bulk). 

---

## Single-cell use cases

Single-cell sequencing, as with bulk sequencing, has now been applied to the study of a wide range of differing assays.

- **scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq - Transcriptomics**
- scATAC-seq/snATAC-seq - Chromatin accessibility
- CITE-seq - Surface protein expression
- AIRR - TCR/BCR profiling
- Spatial-seq - Spatial profiling of gene expression.

---

## Single-cell platforms

- **10x Genomics (microfluidics)**
- Smart-seq3 (microfluidics)
- Drop-seq (microfluidics)
- VASA-seq	(FANS)
- inDrop-seq (microfluidics)
- In-house solutions 


Many companies offer single-cell sequencing technologies which may be used with the Illumina sequencer.

---

## Major Single-cell platforms

Two popular major companies offer the most used technologies.

- **10x Genomics**
- Smart-seq3

Major difference between the two are the sequencing depth and coverage profiles across transcripts.

- 10x is 3' biased so will not provide full length transcript coverage.
- As 10x is sequencing only the 3' of transcripts/genes, less sequencing depth is required per transcript/gene

## The 10x Genomics system  - Sequencing R2

**Read 2**

![](./imgs/Read2.png)
---

## The 10x Genomics system  - Sequence reads

The sequence reads contain:- 

- Information on cell identity (10x barcode)
- Information on molecule identity (UMI)
- Information on sample identity (Index read)

---

## From Sequences to Processed data

As with standard bulk sequencing data, the next steps are typically to align the data to a reference genome/transcriptome and summarise data to a signal matrix.

- Align reads to transcriptome and summarise signal to genes for RNAseq
- Align reads to genome, call enriched windows/peaks and summarise signal in peaks.

---

## Processing scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq data.

For the processing of scRNA/snRNA from fastQ to count matrix, there are many options available to us.

**Alignment and counting**
- Cellranger count
- STAR - STARsolo
- Subread cellCounts

**Pseudoalignment and counting**
- Salmon - Alevin
- Kallisto - Bustools

---

## Droplets to counts

.pull-left[
The output of these tools is typically a matrix of the signal attributed to cells and genes (typically read counts).

This matrix is the input for all downstream post-processing, quality control, normalisation, batch correction, clustering, dimension reduction and differential expression analysis.

The output matrix is often stored in a compressed format such as:- 
- MEX (Market Exchange Format)
- HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format)


]
.pull-right[
![overview](./imgs/countingDrops.png)
]

---

## HDF5 format

- Optimized format for big data.
- Contains matrix information alongside column and row information.
- Loom format version of HDF5 most popular.
- Efficient to work with programmatically.

![](https://linnarssonlab.org/loompy/_images/Loom_components.png)

---

## MEX format

- Plain/Compressed text format
- Contains matrix information in tsv file
- Separate row and column files contain barcode (cell) and feature (gene/transcript) information.

## Cell Ranger

- Cell Ranger only runs on linux machines (CentOS/RedHat 7.0+ and Ubuntu 14.04+).
- Typically, due to memory requirements, users run Cell Ranger on a remote server and now their own machines.
- To download Cell Ranger and the required reference on remote server, we typically use the wget command.

Download the software
```{}
wget -O cellranger-7.1.0.tar.gz "https://cf.10xgenomics.com/releases/cell-exp/cellranger-7.1.0.tar.gz?Expires=1686030213&Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9jZi4xMHhnZW5vbWljcy5jb20vcmVsZWFzZXMvY2VsbC1leHAvY2VsbHJhbmdlci03LjEuMC50YXIuZ3oiLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE2ODYwMzAyMTN9fX1dfQ__&Signature=jlyPxMYCCjFJZzrVMPcb7GSVZSYCCbyfnTQO2PlnCszG-ycgpHgUllHuV6l0ke7p5fPgM~m8xiQPiq-5VqDwdXKuGuKXtWMFFtakYnSroj7O79gQf2lKEXpRQlfeou5EEP4KQBjquwfbHZWs-NNFKyGMYjYrt6qxoyMzrcrgl2rEvRO7Pu8vwk0DJFnwRRRu~wFJEaDqUJ4vFXuKw1jT9aus~bzLeF4fsWDVQYfA7H71yc5zBvKxz1tfD-zTm7ARaA6j-gyC3ffQf9K5W7HSMJD8Iqez39-B8SHMwzsBv0o~uPlatSv-1YataeSHQQykRWxjZdrMg-5IL2neGrM8zA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAI7S6A5RYOXBWRPDA"
```

Download reference for Human genome (GRCh38)
```{}
wget -O https://cf.10xgenomics.com/supp/cell-exp/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz
```

---

## Cell Ranger set-up

- Having downloaded the software and references, we can then unpack them.

Unpack software and references
```{}
tar -xzvf cellranger-7.1.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A.tar.gz
```

- Finally we can add the cellranger directory to our PATH.

```{}
 export PATH=/PATH_TO_CELLRANGER_DIRECTORY/cellranger-7.1.0:$PATH
```

---

## Running Cell Ranger count

Now we have the downloaded Cell Ranger software and required pre-build reference for Human (GRCh38) we can start the generation of count data from scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq fastQ data.

Typically FastQ files for your scRNA run will have been generated using the **Cell Ranger mkfastq** toolset to produce a directory a fastQ files. 

We can now use CellRanger count command with our reference and fastQ files to generate our count matrix and associated files.

```{}
cellranger count --id=my_run_name \
   --fastqs=PATH_TO_FASTQ_DIRECTORY \
   --transcriptome=/PATH_TO_CELLRANGER_DIRECTORY/refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A
```
---

## Working with custom genomes

If you are working with a genome which is not Human and/or mouse you will need to find another source for your Cell Ranger reference.

- Luckily many references are pre-built by other consortiums.
- We can build our own references using other tools in Cell Ranger.

---

## Creating your own Cell Ranger references

To create your own references you will need two additional files.

- FASTA file - File containing the full genome sequence for the reference of interest
- GTF file - File containing the gene/transcript models for the reference of interest.

---

## FASTA file (Genome sequence)

- The reference genome stored as a collection of contigs/chromosomes.
- A contig is a stretch of DNA sequence encoded as A,G,C,T,N.
- Typically comes in FASTA format.
    - ">" line contains information on contig
    - Lines following contain contig sequence

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fasta.png" alt="igv" height="300" width="600">
</div>

---

## GTF (Gene Transfer Format)

 <div align="center">
<img src="imgs/gff.png" alt="igv" height="150" width="700">
</div>

- Used to genome annotation.
- Stores position, feature (exon) and meta-feature (transcript/gene) information.

- **Importantly for Cell Ranger Count, only features labelled as exon (_column 3_) will be considered for counting signal in genes**
- **Many genomes label mitochondrial genes with _CDS_ and not _exon_ so these must be updated**

---

## Using Cell Ranger mkgtf

Now we have the gene models in the GTF format we can use the **Cell Ranger mkgtf** tools to validate our GTF and remove any unwanted annotation types using the attribute flag.

Below is an example of how 10x generated the GTF for the Human reference.

```{}
cellranger mkgtf Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.ensembl.gtf \
Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.ensembl.filtered.gtf \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:lncRNA \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:antisense \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_LV_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_V_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_V_pseudogene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_D_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_J_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_J_pseudogene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_C_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:IG_C_pseudogene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:TR_V_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:TR_V_pseudogene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:TR_D_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:TR_J_gene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:TR_J_pseudogene \
                   --attribute=gene_biotype:TR_C_gene
```




---

## Using Cell Ranger mkref

Following filtering of your GTF to the required biotypes, we can use the Cell Ranger mkref tool to finally create our custom reference.

```{}
cellranger mkref --genome=custom_reference \
--fasta=custom_reference.fa  \
--genes=custom_reference_filtered.gtf
```

---

```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){
  cat("class: inverse, center, middle

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Cell Ranger - Output files

---
"    
  )
  
}

```


## Cell Ranger - Outputs

Having completed the Cell Ranger count step, the user will have created a folder named as set by the **--id** flag for count command.

Within this folder will be the **outs/** directory containing all the outputs generated from Cell Ranger count.

![](./imgs/outputs.png)

---

## Cell Ranger - Count Matrices 

The count matrices to be used for further analysis are stored in both MEX and HDF5 formats within the output directories.

The filtered matrix only contains detected, cell-associated barcodes whereas the raw contains all barcodes (background and cell-associated).

**MEX format**
- filtered_feature_bc_matrix
- raw_feature_bc_matrix

**HDF5 format**
- filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5
- raw_feature_bc_matrix.h5

---

## Cell Ranger - BAM files 

.pull-left[
The outs directory also contains a BAM file of alignments for all barcodes against the reference _(possorted_genome_bam.bam)_ as well as an associated BAI index file _(possorted_genome_bam.bam.bai)_.

This BAM file is often used in downstream analysis such as scSplit/Velocyto as well as for the generation of signal graphs such as bigWigs.

## Cell Ranger - Cloupe files 

Cell Ranger also outputs files for visualisation within its own cloupe browser - _cloupe.cloupe_.

This allows for the visualisation of scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq as a t-sne/umap with the ability to overlay metrics of QC and gene expression onto the cells in real time

 <div align="center">

---
## Cell Ranger - Metrics and Web-summary files

Cell Ranger will also output summaries of useful metrics as a text file _(metrics_summary.csv)_ and as a intuitive web-page.

Metrics include

- Counts/UMIs per cell.
- Number of cells detected.
- Alignment quality.
- Distibution of reads in genomic features.
- Sequencing saturation
- t-sne/UMAP with default clustering.

---
## QC is essential.

.pull-left[
There are many potential issues which can arise in scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq data including -

- Empty droplets.
- Low quality cell (dead or dying)
- Ambient RNA contamination.
- Doublet detection

## Web Summary overview - Knee plot

.pull-left[

The Cell panel also includes and interactive knee plot.

The knee plot shows:- 

- On the x-axis, the barcodes ordered by the most frequent on the left to the least frequent on the right

- On the y-axis, the frequency of each ordered barcode.

- Highlighted in blue are the barcodes marked as associated to cells.

## Web Summary overview - Knee plot

.pull-left[

It is apparent that barcodes labelled blue (cell-associated barcodes) do not have a cut-off based on UMI count.

In the latest version of Cell Ranger a two step process is used to define cell-associated barcodes based on the EmptyDrops method (Lun et al.,2019).

- First high RNA containing cells are identified based on a UMI cut-off.
- Second, low UMI containing cells are used as a background training set to identify additonal cell-associated barcodes not called in first step.

If required, a **--force-cells** flag can be used with _cellranger count_ to identify a set number of cell-associated barcodes.

## Web Summary overview - Knee plot

.pull-left[

The Knee plot also acts a good QC tools to investigate differing types of single cell failure.

Whereas our previous knee plot represented a good sample, differing knee plot patterns can be indicative of specific problems with the single cell protocol.

In this example we see no specific cliff and knee suggesting a failure in the integration of oil, beads and samples (wetting failure) or a compromised sample.

## Web Summary overview - Knee plot

.pull-left[

There may be occasions where we see two sets of cliff-and-knees in our knee plot.

This could be indicative of a heterogenous sample where we have two populations of cells with differing overall RNA levels.

Knee plots should be interpreted in the context of the biology under investigation.
